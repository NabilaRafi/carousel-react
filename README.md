This is Mobile-first application.

Tech stack used:

API call: Axios, POST method

Maintaing app state: Redux, Redux thunk, and react-redux

Unit testing: Jest, react-test-renderer, @testing-library/react

Accessiblity: images are created with Alt

Basic components are created for Left and Right arrows, and a slider component for holding the images. CarouselContainer Parent component is created to hold all the above mentioned components.

Note: Only Left arrow is attached in the shared assessment folder, so used the same arrow for Next and Prev. Lesser time to tweak the SVG
